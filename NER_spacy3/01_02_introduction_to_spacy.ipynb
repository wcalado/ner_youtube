   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "In order to engage in NLP, a researcher must first decide upon the framework they wish to use. **Framework** is a word that describes the software used by the researcher to engage in a specific task. A good way to think about a framework in Pythonic terms is as a **library**, or packaged set of usable classes and functions to perform complex tasks easily. Deciding which framework to use depends on a few variables. I will use the word \"Pythonic\" throughout this book. **Pythonic** is a term programmers of Python use to refer to the standard, or community-accepted, way to do something. A good example is the way in which one imports pandas, a library for analyzing and working with tabular data. When we import pandas, we import it as pd. Why? Because the documentation told us to do so **and**, perhaps even more importantly, everyone in the community follows this syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, not all frameworks support all languages and not all frameworks support the same languages equally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, certain frameworks perform certain tasks better than others. While all frameworks will tokenize equally well (usually), the way in which some tasks, such as finding the root of words via lemmatization (spaCy) vs. stemming (Stanza) will vary. Decision on a framework for this purpose typically lies in the realm of computational linguistics or distance reading for the purpose of finding how a word (or words) appear in texts in all forms (conjugated and declined).\n",
    "\n",
    "A common third thing to consider is the way in which the framework performs NLP. There are essentially two methods for performing NLP: rules-based and machine learning-based. **Rules-based** NLP is the process by which the frameworks has a predetermined set of rules for how to handle specific tasks. In order to find entities in a text, for example, a rules-based method will contain a dictionary of all types of entities or it may contain a RegEx formula for identifying patterns that match an entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most frameworks today are moving away from a rules-based approach to NLP in favor of a machine learning-based approach. **Machine learning-based** NLP is the process by which developers use statistics to teach a computer system (known as a model) to perform a task based on past experiences (known as training). We will be speaking much more about machine learning-based NLP later in a later notebook as spaCy, the chief subject of this notebook, is a machine learning-based Python library."

SpaCy is also capable of easily improving or training from scratch custom models on domain-specific texts.\n",

There are, however, many other forms, such as sentence tokenization. **Sentence tokenization** is precisely the same as word tokenization, except instead of breaking a text up into individual word and punctuation components, we break a text up into individual sentences.\n",

    "The final item I'd like to explore in this notebook is lemmatization. **Lemmatization** is an essential component in most NLP frameworks, though some libraries perform this concept differently. While libraries, such as Stanza will find word stems, spaCy will find word lemmas. They are technically a little different, but both seek to reduce all words to their roots. To find lemmas via spaCy, we use the same process as we did for finding a word's part of speech, via iterating over the tokens in the doc object."
