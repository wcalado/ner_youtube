    "The goal of machine learning models is to be able to generalize well on unseen data. The best way to get the model to generalize well on all unseen data (or at least a lot of it), is to give the model texts is a wide variety. Variety is key when training because variety allows for a model to learn different things from different types of texts, which are written in different styles, dialects, contexts, etc. So the first thing you need to consider when putting together a corpus to generate training data from is, variety. So, with that in mind, give the model as much textual data as you can."

Text segmentation is the process by which you break up the large corpus (sometimes millions of documents) into managable sizes delinated in a single text file by line breaks (my preference). I find it is always good to think about the size of training data I want to give the model. If I am working with Latin texts, I choose a segment size that is a chapter (usually 4-20 sentences). If I am working with USHMM oral testimonies, I segment the corpus by blocks of question-answer. If I am working with regular textual data, I may segment the text at individual sentences.\n",
