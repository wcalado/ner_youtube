    "In this notebook, we are going to be looking much more closely at training sets, what they are, why they are important, and how we can use spaCy's EntityRuler to automate the creation of a good (not great!) training dataset that will require a manual check. In the next video, I will show you how to use this training set to train a custom NER model in spaCy.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the nice things about spaCy, besides the fact that it scales very well (meaning it can perform well on small data and big data), is that it is easy to customize and perform advanced machine learning methods with little to no knowledge of machine learning. Understanding the basics of ML, however, as discussed in notebook 03 of this series, is helpful because it will allow you to understand *how* to cultivate a good training set and *why* certain methods may fail or struggle. In truth, you will develop of a sense of what works and what doesn't work in ML NER by simply doing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Notebook 03 of this series, I mentioned that data for training a machine learning model existed in three forms: training data, validation data, and testing data. All this data will take the same form. It will be a list data structure within which each index will contain a text (a sentence, paragraph, or entire text). The length of this text will depend on what you are hoping to achieve via ML NER. The size of the text will affect the training process. For now, however, let us ignore that. The only other component the training data requires is a list of the entities in that text with their start position, end position, and label. During the training process, these annotations will allow the convolutional neural network (the architecture behind spaCy's machine learning training process), to learn from the data and be able to correctly identify the entities you are training."

    "SpaCy requires that your training data be in a very specific form:\n",
    "\n",
    "TRAIN_DATA = [\n",
    "              (TEXT AS A STRING, {\"entities\": [(START, END, LABEL)]})\n",
    "              ]\n",
    "              \n",
    "Note that TRAIN_DATA is capitalized. It is Pythonic not to capitalize objects with a few exceptions. TRAIN_DATA is one of these exceptions. I don't know the history of this convention, but in every book/tutorial, you will always see TRAIN_DATA done this way. It is, of course, not necessary, but it is always good practice to be as Pythonic as possible in your code so that others will be able to more easily read your code. Any machine learning practitioner will expect to see TRAIN_DATA as such.\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting the training data into this format is very difficult by hand. A researcher would have to count the characters to assign the start and end of the entity. Even if you consider using Python built-in string functions to get the start and end character, you will run into another problem. The way in which spaCy's training process reads the start and end characters is different than the way you may count them with the string functions. This means that in the training process, spaCy will drop the annotations that don't align with the start and end of a token. The reason for this is because of how spaCy tokenizes when compared to how your string functions tokenize the text. Fortunately, there are solutions built into spaCy via the EntityRuler to aid you in this process.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are interested in manual annotation, I highly encourage you to explore the paid software from Explosion AI, Prodigy (https://prodi.gy/). I am in no way being paid to promote that product. It is expensive, but if you need to do a lot of annotations (for images, text, video, or even audio), then Prodigy is the tool for you. It has a nice user-interface and because it is developed by the same team who gives us spaCy, it can fit seamlessly into a spaCy workflow. You can explore the Prodigy demo here: https://prodi.gy/demo."

    "In the code below, we will make a spaCy machine learning training set via the EntityRuler. In other words, we will use a rules-based method to automatically generate a basic training set. Will this training set have mistakes? Possibly. That's why it is a good idea to look at the training set and manually verify it. By doing it in this manner, however, you can vastly increase prototyping to see if the custom entity you want to train is potentially viable. In machine learning, there are rarely concrete solutions for domain-specific problems. If there were, people wouldn't need specialists. Experimentation is often the name of the game in machine learning and it is no different with NER machine learning.\n",

This model with only have an EntityRuler which we will temporarily use to generate the training set. Recall in our last notebook that the spaCy small model could not identify Treblinka correctly as a location? In the below code, we will create a basic training set from these three sentences that will allow us to generate a very small training set. I want to be clear. This training data is nowhere near enough to train a model. This process scales very well, however.\n",
