    "Gensim is a powerful Python library that was originally designed to produce good topic models. **Topic models** are machine learning models that read over an entire corpus and cluster individual documents into clusters of similarity. In order to produce good results, Gensim (and other topic modeling methods) are reliant upon numerical represntations of words. In other words, these methods depend on word vectors. To have accurate results, therefore, Gensim is capable of generating word vectors with relatively minimal code. SpaCy, on the other hand, is an NLP library not capable of generating custom word vectors. While users can inject to words into models, spaCy is not designed to generate word vectors on its own. For this reason, even spaCy's documentation recomends using other libraries, such as Gensim to generate word vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will be going through the process of generating our own word vectors. In order to reduce the time to perform the task at hand, we will use a toy corpus. This process, however, can easily be scaled for a corpus of millions of documents."

    "\n",
    "1) First, we need to remove the stopwords from the corpus. Stopwords are words that occur frequently in a corpus, so frequently that they do not necessarily offer much meaning for distant reading and, as a result, throw off machine learning models. Other stopwords are words that occur with high frequency in a langauge as a whole. For our purposes, we will use the following stopwords available from the NLTK (natural language toolkit)"
